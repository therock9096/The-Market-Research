By 2032, the market is anticipated to reach approximately $13 billion.</p> <p>Additionally, the growing public awareness regarding environmental conservation and climate change issues is prompting municipalities to allocate more resources toward gardening and landscaping services. This has led to the adoption of advanced technologies and sustainable gardening practices, further fueling market growth. As cities are increasingly seeking to improve their ecological footprints, the integration of native plant species and water-efficient landscaping techniques are becoming common practices among municipal services.</p> <p>As the demand for municipal gardening services continues to rise, the market is poised for several developments.
